# DenaryBinaryHexOctalGUIVer
Converts from one numeric base (binary, hexadecimal etc.) to another with a GUI made with WPF.

**ROADMAP:**
- Allow support for comma separated values and spaces
- Decimal support?
- Re-order UI
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Do something about bases greater than 36
  - Potentially add option to use (10),(11),(12) instead of A, B, C?
- Realtime conversion? (convert as the user is typing)
- Prevent the entering of invalid characters instead of just telling the user off and wiping both the input and output fields
- Basic binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and left shift and right shift operators?
- Support for non Windows platforms
